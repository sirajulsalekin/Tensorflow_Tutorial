# Tensorflow_Tutorial
This repository contains the code used to demonstrate the Tensorflow and Tensorboard tutorial in 'Deep Learning' graduate class in Fall 2017 at ECE UTSA

The code builds a simple CNN model for DNA sequence classification task. Given a DNA sequence of 100 bp, the model predicts whether CTCF transcription factor binds to the sequence or not.
